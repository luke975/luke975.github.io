# thelukeweb
Its thelukeweb, but actually a website?! OMG!!

# Compatibility
Doens't work on IE8 on Windows XP, so I guess IE9+
So basically Windows 7 and up!
(If downloading website through source code, it works fine on Windows XP)

# Copying?
You are totally allowed to copy the whole website and customize it, just give me credit for making the original site. Thanks :)
