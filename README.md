# thelukeweb
Its thelukeweb, but actually a website?! OMG!!

# Compatibility
Doens't work on IE8 on Windows XP, but works with Firefox 52 on XP. So, guessing 2000 / ME doesn't have a Firefox version supporting my website, the website is supported for Windows XP and higher!

# Copying?
You are totally allowed to copy the whole website and customize it, just give me credit for making the original site*. *If its customized so much its unrecognizable to TLW, then you dont need to.
